# Presentation

## Presentation is a layer of clean architecture, this layer is where the data is grouped from the usecases and services and then present it to the user. This is the last layer before the framework.

&nbsp;

In this layer we have controllers and serializers.

## Folders

### `controllers`

Folder to store the controllers of the application. The controllers wrap the usecases and services and present the data to the user.

### `serializers`

Folder to store the serializers of the application. The serializers are like validators.
